# Landing Page

> The aim of this project was to create typical landing page with Flexbox.

### Page layout:

![Layout](./img/design/layout.png)

### Page style:

![Layout](./img/design/fonts&colors.png)

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS

### Difficulties that I faced during this project:

1. At the beginning it was really hard to understand how to create that section with header and hero so they are centered and background color is at full width of the viewport. At first I just created external wrapper with that bg, but that was a bit clunky, and after some time I came up with better solution of the universal container that I could reuse throughout my page.
2. While I was writing the styles, I understood that my code is a mess (mb it's still a bit messy c:), and it's hard to work with it. I didn't reuse any classes and it was hard to navigate around. Then, I remembered about comments and my life became a bit easier ^^, also I created a universal button class that I reused a couple of times, I think that's how cool CSS guys write code B)

### Summary

> At the start I was a bit overwhelmed and I thought that I will not handle this. But section after section I just kept going and actually, as a result, that wasn't so hard. Main difficulty that I faced is when I tried to guess how to do layout the right way. I cannot actually say that it is done perfectly, but anyways let's keep going to the next challenges.
